# TempoFunk

Make-a-Video like model using stable diffusion

## Samples:


We add extra temporal attention and freeze the rest of the unet, similar to make-a-video (?)

Based on [lucidrains/make-a-video-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/make-a-video-pytorch) and [lxj616's make-a-stable-diffusion-video](https://github.com/lucidrains/make-a-video-pytorch/issues/10)
